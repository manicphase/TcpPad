This is a small app written for Android 2.3.3 (API 10) that's known to work all the way up to Android 4.3.

It's part of two examples of using TCP to interact between a python client and server.

At the minute you need to find the IP of the computer running the pygame example on my profile and manually edit line 27 of TCPClient.java to point toward it.

This will be fixed to be set on the phone soon.
